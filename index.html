        <p>Learning to cook has always been something I have tried to do and lately I have gotten to the point where I
            can cook if I have a well written recipe but it doesn't always turn out and that's where mom comes in. She
            has been cooking for a long time first when she was learning to cook and now teaching all those who ask how.
            One of the great things she has with her cooking is that she can cook for anyone no matter the limitations
            they have with food. This is where we will be making recipes and putting them up so that everyone can learn
            how to cook. </p>
        <p> 5 reasons why I am learning to cook for food limitations</p>

                <li>I have my own food limitations</li>
                <li>It is always nice to be able to cook for anyone</li>
                <li>I need to learn how to cook</li>
                <li>As more people are choicing to eat in different ways I will need to be able to cook for them </li>
                <li>It is healthier to cook</li>
